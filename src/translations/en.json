      "title": "What is a lazy eye?",
      "description1": "Amblyopia, commonly known as \"lazy eye\", is an eye condition that affects approximately 3% of the world's population. It develops during childhood when the brain and one eye don't work together properly.",
      "description2": "In this condition, the brain favors one eye over the other, which can cause vision problems in the less-used eye. Over time, the \"lazy\" eye can develop reduced vision if not properly treated.",
      "description3": "Although amblyopia is primarily diagnosed in childhood, recent studies show that the adult brain retains the plasticity necessary to improve visual function through specific exercises.",
